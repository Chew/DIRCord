 Welcome to DIRCord!

## You might be wondering, what *is* a DIRCord?  
Well, DIRCord, is an amazing project created by chew, that connects a Discord guild with the amazing (and far superior) IRC or **I**nternet **R**elay **C**hat.
---
## This is done through the use of a ruby bot that connects to the IRC server you specify and allows you to send and receive messages, as well as authenticate with nameserv, hostserv, operserv, and send direct messages to other users.
