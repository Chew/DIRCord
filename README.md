# DIRCord

The only IRC Client you'll ever need, guaranteed!

## Features

- Create a discord server, each channel on discord corresponds to a channel on IRC!
- Creating a channel on discord joins the channel on IRC.
- Deleting a channel on discord leaves the channel on IRC!
- Speak in a channel name on discord, will send to that channel with same name on IRC and vice versa!

## Missing Features

Check the [issues](http://github.com/Chewsterchew/DIRCord/issues) to see what I'm planning next, or to suggest new things!
